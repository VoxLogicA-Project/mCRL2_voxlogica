# This script is the default script to compile rewriter
# libraries. It is generated, so to change compiling
# behaviour, follow the following steps:
#
# - Create a new script (perhaps based on this one)
# - Let the MCRL2_COMPILEREWRITER environment variable
#   point to the new script.
#
# Requirements for a compile script: the output (both
# stdout and stderr!) must consist solely of a newline-
# separated list of files. The last file in the list is
# treated as the compiler library, and must be a valid
# executable. All files listed in the output are deleted
# once the rewriter library is no longer needed.

if [ -z "$CXX" ]; then  # Let user choose via $CXX
  CXX=`which c++`       # Then test for c++
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    CXX=`which clang++` # Then prefer clang over gcc
  fi
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    CXX=`which g++`     # Test for gcc
  fi
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    CXX="g++"         # Last resort: use compiler from build.
